# Introduction to Data Structures ans Algorithm

## What is Data Structures?

### Organizing data in computer memory efficiently so that it is easy to find and modify when required
### Explanation
#### Imagine storing cloths in your closet so that you can find them quickly, you wouldn't store them randomly right?
#### so it is very similar to organize data in computer memory 

### Types of Data Structure
#### 1. Arrays (like bookshelves)
#### 2. Linked Lists (like a chain of books)
#### 3. Stacks (like a pile of books)
#### 4. Queues (like a line of people)
#### 5. Trees (like a family tree)
#### 6. Graphs (like a map)

## What is Algorithm?

### Step by step procedures to solve a problem or perform a task efficiently
#### Relation between DS and Algo - DS are the containers and Algorithms are the actions performed on those containers
### Types of Algos
#### 1. Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
#### 2. Searching (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
#### 3. Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)
#### 4. Dynamic Programming (e.g., Fibonacci, Longest Common Subsequence)
#### 5. Greedy Algorithms (e.g., Huffman Coding)
#### 6. Divide and Conquer (e.g., Merge Sort, Binary Search)
